                <h2>What you will need to get started</h2>
                <p>Playing a guitar is so easy, so you will just need your guitar and of course your hand to play.</p>
                <p>Get ready to dive into the most thrilling journey of your life</p>
                <h2>Let's get into it</h2>
                <h3>Strings</h3>
                <p>Just like most things ,they are also named, yes you heard that right!</p>
                <p>That is as follows</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>E</li>
                    <li>A</li>
                    <li>D</li>
                    <li>G</li>
                    <li>B</li>
                    <li>e</li>

                </ol>
                <h3>Chords</h3>
                <p>Simply put this is a collection of notes which sound good together.</p>
                <p>Think of notes like ingredients that when added together forms a wonderful and tasty dish(chords) </p>
                <p>The chords, similar to notes, run between A to G and having a sharp between each, but this is not always as so</p>
                <p>It goes as so; A, A# ,B ,c ,c# ,D ,D# ,E ,F ,F# ,G and lastly G#</p>
